📚 C++ Module 01 - Detailed Exercise Breakdown
🧟 ex00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
Topic: Memory Allocation (Stack vs Heap)

Creates Zombie class with basic constructor/destructor
Implements newZombie() - allocates zombie on heap (with new)
Implements randomChump() - creates zombie on stack (automatic storage)
Learning Goal: Understanding when objects persist beyond function scope 🔄
🧟‍♂️ **ex01: Moar brainz! **
Topic: Dynamic Array Allocation

Creates zombieHorde() function that allocates N zombies using new[]
Practices array allocation and proper cleanup with delete[]
Learning Goal: Managing arrays of objects dynamically allocated on the heap 📦
🧠 ex02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
Topic: Pointers vs References

Demonstrates differences between:
String variable (std::string str)
Pointer to string (std::string *stringPTR)
Reference to string (std::string &stringREF)
Compares memory addresses and value access patterns
Learning Goal: Understanding C++ references vs pointers 🎯
⚔️ ex03: Unnecessary violence
Topic: References in Class Members

Implements Weapon, HumanA, and HumanB classes
HumanA holds weapon by reference (always armed)
HumanB holds weapon by pointer (can be unarmed)
Learning Goal: When to use references vs pointers in class design 🏗️
📝 ex04: Sed is for losers
Topic: File I/O and String Manipulation

Creates file string replacement tool (like sed command)
Takes: filename, search string, replace string
Outputs to filename. replace
Uses std::ifstream, std::ofstream, and std::string::find()
Learning Goal: C++ file streams and string operations 📄
🗣️ ex05: Harl 2.0
Topic: Pointers to Member Functions

Implements Harl class with complaint levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
Uses pointers to member functions for elegant method dispatch
Avoids long if/else chains with function pointer arrays
Learning Goal: Advanced function pointers in C++ 🔧
🎚️ ex06: Harl filter
Topic: Switch Statements and Filtering

Extends ex05 with severity-based filtering using switch statement
Demonstrates fall-through behavior in switch cases
Filters messages based on minimum severity level
Learning Goal: Switch statements and control flow patterns 🚦
🎓 Overall Module Theme
Memory Management, References, and C++ Fundamentals This module focuses on understanding C++'s memory model, the difference between stack/heap allocation, references vs pointers, and essential C++ programming patterns! 💡✨
